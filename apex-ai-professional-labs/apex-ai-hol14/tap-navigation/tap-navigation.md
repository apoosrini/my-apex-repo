## Introduction

Create a grouped navigation menu for TAP app. Keep contextual pages available through report links and buttons rather than adding them to the main menu.

- Create parent navigation entries.
- Assign TAP pages to menu groups.
- Add icons and verify the runtime menu.

## Task 1: Create the parent entries
